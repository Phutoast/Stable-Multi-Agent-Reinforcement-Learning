# Consensus Optimization 

Consensus Optimization is an idea from https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10461. This code is written in pyTorch and inspired by https://gist.github.com/LMescheder/b4d57e094cc8522497fdb5cf8fb44676

## Original GAN Implementation 
At first, I tried to reproduce the result from the paper using mixture of Gaussians as a toy task in the original paper. 

This is the result.
