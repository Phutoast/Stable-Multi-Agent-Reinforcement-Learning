# Consensus Optimization 

Consensus Optimization is an idea from https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10461, where the paper aims to ["fix-GAN"](http://www.inference.vc/my-notes-on-the-numerics-of-gans/), so that it has better convergence properties through the analyzed of "smooth 2-players games".

So, this might have an application on the multi-agent reinfocement learning training, with self play, the agent with consensus optimization converges to tit-for-tat strategy.
